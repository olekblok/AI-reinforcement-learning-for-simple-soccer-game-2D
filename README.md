The game engine was written in Python using Pygame for the GUI, following an object-oriented approach. Reinforcement learning was implemented using the PyTorch library. The neural network architecture was designed with the DNN_QNet class, utilizing fully connected layers. This integration allows the agent to learn and make decisions within the game environment based on the predictions of the neural network.
